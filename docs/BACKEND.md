# Backend Design

> Language: Rust (single binary, musl) · Platform: OpenWrt 25.12.x (x86 / ARM64) · Service name: `wifisync`
> Positioning: **no mesh** — a single home network is built from "Controller admission + network
> information distribution + 802.11k/v/r roaming + standard Wi-Fi relay".
> Core principle: **zero intrusion by default** — only a "pure AP" device is modified by the program;
> Gateway/Controller only read, probe, and distribute.
> Lifecycle discipline: **back up the initial network before start, restore the previous network before stop**.

The LuCI interface is documented separately in [`FRONTEND.md`](FRONTEND.md); build and CI details
are in [`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md).

## 1. Requirements traceability (Requirements → Design → Acceptance)

| # | Requirement | Design highlights | Modules | Acceptance |
|---|-------------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| R1 | Include a LuCI interface | The daemon only exposes a local UNIX-socket JSON API → the `rpcd` exec plugin bridges it to a **ubus object** → LuCI JS calls it with `rpc.declare()` (no new protocol) | `luci/luci-app-wifisync/`, `files/usr/libexec/rpcd/wifisync` | ubus `list/call` walkthrough + browser regression (see [`FRONTEND.md`](FRONTEND.md)) |
| R2 | Do not use libraries that fail to build with musl | Dependency allow-list + pure-Rust cryptography + musl linking, see §4 | whole project, `.cargo/config.toml` | all musl targets compile + single binary ≤ 3 MiB |
| R3 | Roles Controller/AP/Gateway; AP disabled without wireless | A role is a **capability set**; without wireless the default roles drop AP and the UI greys it out | `core::role`, `sys::capability` | a wireless-less device defaults to `{controller,gateway}`; the AP checkbox is disabled |
| R4 | Support KVR, not mesh; relay via standard Wi-Fi relay | Emit hostapd/wpa_supplicant KVR parameters; relay = `wpa_supplicant(STA)` + `hostapd(AP)` (+`relayd`), **no 802.11s** | `core::profile`, `core::plan` | hwsim two-AP roaming logs / handover latency; no mesh branch in the code |
| R5 | ⚠️ Narrowed: **only a "pure AP"** merges all ports into `br-lan` | Bridge condition = `ap && !gateway && !controller`; any other combination **creates no bridge and touches no port** | `core::bridge`, `core::plan` | in the pure-AP case all ports join `br-lan`; for `ap+controller` / `ap+gateway` / `controller+gateway` the dry-run diff is empty |
| R6 | Optional: restore the default network when Controller/Gateway is unreachable | Heartbeat + dead-man timer + rollback engine (three layers), off by default; **AP devices only** | `core::failsafe`, `daemon` | after the link timeout the device restores the default network and becomes reachable again |
| R7 | Gateway **never changes any network setting for the user**, it only asks for the LAN interface | Gateway = read-only identification role: the user selects the "corresponding LAN interface" for topology/alerting; the write plan is always empty | `core::role`, `wifisync-sys` | after selecting a LAN port the local uci/network diff stays **0 bytes** |
| R8 | Controller by default only does "new AP validation" + "network information distribution", without touching the existing network | Controller writes no local network configuration; connectivity to the Gateway is **confirmed by the user** (the program only probes, and never changes routes/NAT/firewall) | `core::admission`, `core::plan`, `wifisync::probe` | the admission list can be approved/rejected; the connectivity check is a read-only probe plus an explicit confirmation badge |
| R9 | AP by default syncs the network information distributed by the Controller (including Wi-Fi); the Wi-Fi source is one of three choices | Sources: `controller_self` / `gateway` / `custom`; a source device reporting "no Wi-Fi" disables that source; choosing `custom` while AP and Controller are on the **same device** also modifies that device's Wi-Fi | `core::wifi_source`, `core::profile` | the three sources switch and disable correctly; the same-device `custom` case generates the right wireless configuration (with double confirmation) |
| R10 | Not hard-coded: reserve multi-bridge / cross-device VLAN bridge sync | Plan structures are always **lists** (`Vec<BridgePlan>`, `vlans[]`, `bridges[]`); by default exactly one `br-lan` is produced | `core::bridge`, `core::profile` | unit tests cover multi-bridge + VLAN tagged/untagged relations; no hard-coded single-bridge branch |
| R11 | **The initial network parameters must be backed up before the service starts and restored before it stops** | Lifecycle hooks: `pre_start` → create the **immutable initial baseline** `initial/` on first run (+ a rolling snapshot per start); `pre_stop` → **synchronously restore** from the baseline before exiting; includes dirty-flag detection, integrity verification, and `managed_only`/`full` restore scopes | `core::backup`, `sys::snapshot`, `sys::restore`, `etc/init.d/wifisync` | after one start/stop cycle the network configuration diff against the initial baseline is 0; after `kill -9` the next start detects the dirty state and warns/restores |
| R12 | The Controller is the **forwarding centre**: it listens on port 6550 (configurable) and has its own accounts; AP and Gateway log in with them, except over loopback (same device); the Gateway reports its LAN bridge, network, DHCP range and IPv6 policy | TCP + JSON lines, PBKDF2/HMAC challenge-response with mutual proof, ChaCha20-Poly1305 frames, loopback exemption, periodic `sync`; see §7.1 | `core::link`, `core::lan`, `sys::lan`, `wifisync::{link,accounts}`, `daemon/link_glue` | login with a wrong/missing password fails; a loopback AP/Gateway syncs without an account; the Controller holds the Gateway LAN report and forwards it to admitted APs |

**Cross-cutting principles**

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Zero intrusion | The Gateway / Controller roles themselves **produce no network configuration writes**; only the `ap` role writes (and only after admission + double confirmation + apply-guard) |
| Explicit confirmation | Risky actions such as connectivity and same-device Wi-Fi changes are always confirmed by an explicit user click; the program only probes and previews |
| Least responsibility | Controller = validate + distribute; Gateway = identify + probe endpoints; AP = apply + report |
| Reversible | **Back up before changing, restore before exiting**: every network write is preceded by a baseline snapshot, and the service must restore the initial network before it stops (see §8) |

**UI text and message keys**

* The backend never sends finished sentences to the web UI. Hint fields (`plan.notes`,
  `bridge_blocked_reason`, `failsafe.state_label`, Wi-Fi source reasons, role adjustments,
  backup/restore summaries, apply/gateway messages, probe details, …) are
  `wifisync_core::Message` values — a stable `key` plus optional `params` — which the front end
  translates (see [`FRONTEND.md`](FRONTEND.md)).
* `WritePlan::dry_run_text()` is language neutral: it only renders the uci commands, while the
  notes travel separately as messages.
* Operational identifiers stay stable keys the UI maps itself (role names, `dirty_reason`,
  admission states).
* Everything the CLI and the service print is **plain English** — usage text, results, error
  messages (`CoreError` / `SysError`) and log lines — and is never translated; only the web UI is
  localized (see the `CLI` section in `AGENTS.md`).

---

## 2. Role model

| Role | Default | Responsibility (narrowed) | Changes to the existing local network | Bridge |
|------|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| `gateway` | on when wireless is present | **identification only**: the user selects the "corresponding LAN interface" in the UI for topology display and alerting; provides a connectivity probe endpoint | **none** (no uci writes, no netifd calls, no NAT/firewall changes) | no bridge |
| `controller` | on when wireless is present | ① **new AP validation (admission)** ② **network information distribution (including Wi-Fi)** ③ heartbeat aggregation and topology display | **none** (does not change the local network; whether it can reach the Gateway is **confirmed by the user**) | no bridge |
| `ap` | on when wireless is present; **forced off without wireless** | sync and apply the information distributed by the Controller (Wi-Fi / mobility domain), report status | applies only the distributed wireless/bridge information, and **only after admission + double confirmation** | **pure AP only** |

**Bridge policy (the only condition)**

```
enable_bridge = roles.ap && !roles.gateway && !roles.controller
```

Implementation: `wifisync-core::plan::build_write_plan` returns an empty plan for every non-AP role
combination, and the reversible side lives in `wifisync-sys::snapshot` / `wifisync-sys::restore`
driven by the daemon lifecycle hooks.

**Role decision matrix**

| Condition | Default roles | Local configuration writes | Bridge policy |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Wireless + main router | `controller + gateway + ap` | Wi-Fi only (from the Controller distribution / selected source) | no bridge |
| Wireless + pure AP | `ap` | Wi-Fi + bridge | all ports → `br-lan` |
| Wireless + AP and Controller on the same device | `controller + ap` | Wi-Fi only (with a `custom` source, the local Wi-Fi too) | no bridge |
| Wireless + AP and Gateway on the same device | `gateway + ap` | Wi-Fi only | no bridge |
| No wireless + main router | `controller + gateway` (AP disabled/greyed out) | **none** | no bridge (only the user-selected LAN interface is recorded) |
| No wireless + pure controller | `controller` | **none** | no bridge |

---

## 3. Dependency selection (musl constraints)

| Purpose | Choice | Avoided / rationale |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Runtime | **std threads + blocking I/O** (no `tokio`) | The service only needs a UNIX socket + timers + threads; std is enough and it avoids a huge runtime |
| Serialization | `serde` + `serde_json` | pure Rust |
| Network configuration | **uci + ubus/netifd** (no `rtnetlink`) | Bridge setup writes uci `config device type bridge` then `ubus call network reload` — the idiomatic OpenWrt approach, which also avoids handling DSA/swconfig differences ourselves |
| State reading | `sysfs` + `/etc/board.json` + `iwinfo` | read-only; does not rely on `ip -j` (busybox `ip` does not support JSON) |
| Local API | "one JSON per line" protocol over a UNIX socket (no `httparse`/`hyper`/`axum`) | one less protocol parsing surface and fewer dependencies; the socket is isolated with mode 0600 |
| Inter-node authentication | `hmac` + `sha2` + `chacha20poly1305` | pure Rust, available on all architectures (including MIPS) |
| Signals | `libc` (only `sigaction`) | SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP; everything else goes through std |
| Errors | `thiserror` | compile-time macro, no runtime overhead |
| Credential/state storage | JSON files with atomic writes (`/etc/wifisync/`, 0600) | avoids SQLite size and musl cross-compilation pain |
| CLI parsing | hand-written (`match` in `main.rs`) | the command set is fixed, so no dependency is needed |
| ❌ Forbidden | `openssl-sys`, `ring`, `aws-lc-rs`, `git2`, `libz-sys` (non-bundled), any crate requiring `cmake` | unreliable under musl/cross-compilation and for size; **`ring` does not support MIPS/MIPSEL** |
| ⚠️ Use with care | `regex`, `libsqlite3-sys`, `tokio` with all features | significantly increase the binary size |

**Security model (why there is no TLS)**

* Local API: UNIX socket `/var/run/wifisync/wifisync.sock`, mode `0600`, root only;
* Between nodes (the Controller link, §7.1): account login proven with HMAC-SHA256 over a PBKDF2 key, then ChaCha20-Poly1305 frames (pure Rust); loopback peers need no login;
* **TLS is deliberately not introduced**: `openssl-sys` is painful under musl/cross-compilation,
  `ring` does not support MIPS, and `aws-lc-rs` requires cmake. HTTPS for the web UI is left to
  OpenWrt's own uhttpd.

---

## 4. Build and size constraints

| Item | Measure |
|------|---------|
| Target triples | `x86_64` / `i686` / `i586` / `aarch64` `-unknown-linux-musl` (covering all x86 and ARM64 package architectures of OpenWrt 25.12) |
| Linking | the **official OpenWrt SDK**'s `*-musl-gcc` with `-C target-feature=-crt-static` (link dynamically against the device's musl, matching the official `rust-values.mk`) |
| Size | `opt-level="z"`, `lto=true`, `codegen-units=1`, `panic="abort"`, `strip`; CI gate **3 MiB** |
| Reproducibility | `Cargo.lock` is committed and every build uses `--locked` |

The architecture mapping table and the CI workflows are documented in
[`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md); both CI and developers share the single implementation
`scripts/openwrt-arch.sh`.

---

## 5. KVR and relay design

| Capability | hostapd (AP side) | wpa_supplicant (STA side) | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| 802.11k | `ieee80211k=1`, `rrm_neighbor_report=1` | `rrm_neighbor_report=1` | neighbor reports |
| 802.11v | `ieee80211v=1`, `bss_transition=1` | `bss_transition=1` | client steering |
| 802.11r | `ieee80211r=1`, `mobility_domain=`, `ft_over_ds=1`, `ft_psk_generate_local=1`, `r0kh`/`r1kh`/`nasid` | `ieee80211r=1`, `mobility_domain=`, `ft_psk_generate_local=1` | fast roaming, FT over DS |

* The **full `wpad`** package is required, not `wpad-basic`; an integrity check runs before start
  and prints install guidance when it is missing.
* None of the KVR parameters are **hard-coded locally**: they are distributed by the Controller
  with the `NetworkProfile.wifi[].kvr` structure (see §6), and `mobility_domain` is globally
  unique so that fast roaming works across APs.
* An AP must already be admitted before it applies Wi-Fi configuration (see §7).
* **Relay (no mesh)**: `wpa_supplicant(STA)` upstream + `hostapd(AP)` downstream; layer-2
  transparency via `relayd`, or routed mode; 4-address/WDS optional. When 802.11r is restricted
  on the relay link, fall back to `ft_over_ds`.
* **Client steering** is a separate, optional subsystem — see [`STEERING.md`](STEERING.md). It adds a
  runtime actuation layer on top of this configuration plane and does not change anything described
  above; it is off by default. ⚠️ The 802.11v row in the table above is an **open item**: `STEERING.md`
  §5.1 records that OpenWrt emits hostapd `bss_transition=1` from the uci option `bss_transition`
  while `ieee80211v` has no handler, so these parameters must be verified on the target build.

---

## 6. Wi-Fi information sources and network information sync (R9)

**The Controller's Wi-Fi information source is one of three choices**

| Source | How it is obtained | UI disable condition | Effect on devices |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `controller_self` | read the Controller's own uci `wireless` (`wifi-iface`: SSID/encryption/band/channel) | disabled when the Controller reports "no Wi-Fi" | does not change the Controller's own Wi-Fi; its real profile is pushed to the admitted APs, and when it has no Wi-Fi interface configured the generated default SSID is used instead |
| `gateway` | read-only fetch of the Gateway's Wi-Fi profile (address + credentials entered by the user; **never written back to the Gateway**) | disabled when the Gateway reports "no Wi-Fi" / nothing is selected / the fetch fails | does not change the Gateway |
| `custom` | the user defines SSID, encryption, PSK, band/channel, width, KVR and `mobility_domain` manually in LuCI (a blank SSID or `mobility_domain` is derived, see below) | none (always available) | ⚠️ if the AP and Controller are the **same device**, that device's Wi-Fi is modified as well (double confirmation + dry-run preview + apply-guard required) |

* Disabling is **validated twice**: greyed out in LuCI *and* rejected by the daemon (to prevent bypassing).
* The local Wi-Fi only enters the write plan when "Controller and AP are the same device" and the
  source is `custom`; in all other cases the Controller-side diff is 0.
* Source priority/fallback is configurable, e.g. whether a failed `gateway` fetch falls back to
  `controller_self` (by default there is no automatic fallback, only an alert).
* **The SSID and the mobility domain are derived, not hard-coded.** A blank SSID becomes
  `Home_Wi-Fi_<6 random hex digits>` (generated once and persisted under `/etc/wifisync/`), and a
  blank `mobility_domain` is derived from the SSID with FNV-1a (4 hex digits), so every AP of the
  same network computes the same value with no coordination. Renaming the network therefore changes
  the domain on all APs at once, and an explicitly configured value always wins.
* **The Wi-Fi key is distributed, but never inside the profile.** The Controller ships it in a
  separate `secrets` section of the sync answer — the profile itself travels through LuCI
  (`profile.publish`), and key material must not. The AP stores it in `/etc/wifisync/secrets/`
  (0600, root only); on the Controller's own device the key is read straight from its own
  `wireless` config instead. The write plan carries only a secret **reference**, substituted
  immediately before the `uci` write, so the value never reaches the dry-run text, the logs or the
  UI. An encrypted network whose key is missing or unusable **blocks the plan** and `apply` refuses
  (`wifisync_core::wifi_key`: 8–63 characters, or 64 hex digits for a raw PSK).
* Keys are provisioned with `wifisync secret set <reference>` (value read from stdin, never an
  argument), and listed without values with `wifisync secret list`.

**Distributed content: `NetworkProfile` (list-based and extensible)**

```jsonc
{
  "version": 42,                       // monotonically increasing; on conflict the higher version wins
  "bridges": [                         // a list → multiple bridges in the future
    { "name": "br-lan", "ports": ["lan1","lan2"], "vlan_filtering": false, "vlans": [] }
  ],
  "vlans": [                           // reserved: cross-device VLAN bridge sync
    { "id": 10, "name": "iot", "tagged_ports": [], "untagged_ports": ["lan3"] }
  ],
  "wifi": [                            // one profile per radio
    { "radio": "radio0", "ssid": "Home", "auth": "sae-mixed", "psk_ref": "…",
      "band": "5g", "channel": 44, "kvr": { "k": true, "v": true, "r": true,
      "mobility_domain": "abcd", "ft_over_ds": true } }
  ]
}
```

**AP sync behavior**

| Item | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Sync switch | `sync_mode = auto` (follow the Controller) | can be switched to `local_override` (a local temporary override with a prominent UI warning; a Controller version update does not overwrite the local value) |
| Synced content | network information (bridge/VLAN definitions) + Wi-Fi information (including KVR/mobility domain) | Wi-Fi is mandatory |
| Effective time | when the version number changes | dry-run preview + apply-guard before applying |
| Link loss | keep the last successful configuration | whether to restore the default is decided by failsafe (see §7) |

---

## 7. Controller admission and connectivity confirmation (R8)

**New AP admission flow (one of the Controller's only "active" duties)**

1. After installation the AP starts and reports `device_id` (a persisted UUID) + MAC + wireless
   capabilities + a signature made with its local credentials.
2. The Controller records it as `pending`; the LuCI "admission list" shows it (source IP, MAC,
   time, wireless capabilities).
3. The administrator **explicitly** clicks "approve" → the Controller distributes the
   `NetworkProfile`; clicking "reject" adds it to a blacklist and the AP never writes local
   configuration.
4. Credentials: a Controller **account** (name + password) proven with HMAC-SHA256, then
   `chacha20poly1305` encrypting the frames; **TLS is not used** (see the dependency constraints
   in §3). The full protocol is in §7.1. A device whose roles share the Controller's device connects
   over loopback and is admitted without verification.

**Controller ↔ Gateway connectivity (confirmed by the user separately)**

| Item | Design |
|------|--------|
| Probe method | read-only probes: ICMP echo / TCP port reachability / HTTP probe bytes; the target is configurable (Gateway address or any detection point) |
| Does it change the network | **no** — it does not write the routing table, change the firewall, or touch NAT |
| User confirmation | the UI shows an "unconfirmed / confirmed" badge and requires an explicit click; the state is stored in wifisync's own uci |
| Failure handling | alert only, plus troubleshooting suggestions (no automatic repair) |

> The Controller does not participate in data-plane forwarding; the Gateway's LAN interface
> selection is only used for topology identification and probe-target inference.

### 7.1 Controller link (AP / Gateway ↔ Controller, R12)

The Controller is the forwarding centre. AP and Gateway nodes are TCP clients; they never talk to
each other.

| Item | Design |
|------|--------|
| Listener | Controller role only: `controller_bind` (default `0.0.0.0`) and `controller_port` (default **6550**), both changeable in LuCI/CLI. The listener follows the configuration within a second. With a specific, non-loopback bind address an extra `127.0.0.1` listener is added so that same-device nodes keep the login-free path |
| Framing | one JSON object per line (same style as the local socket); frames are limited to 4 KiB before the login and 512 KiB after it; a started frame must complete within 15 s; at most 32 concurrent connections and 8 per source address; 10 s handshake window; 120 s idle timeout. A session ends as soon as its account is removed or re-keyed |
| Accounts | `/etc/wifisync/accounts.json` (0600), managed on the Controller only (`wifisync account …` or LuCI). Per account: random salt + PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key (4096 iterations); the password is never stored or sent. There are **no default accounts**, so a remote node cannot connect until one is created. Names: 1–32 of `A-Za-z0-9-_.:`; passwords: 8–128 characters |
| Login | `hello` → `challenge{salt,iter,nonce}` → `auth{cnonce,proof}` → `ready{proof}`. Both proofs are HMAC-SHA256 over the nonces and the device id, so the node also verifies the Controller. Unknown users get a decoy salt (no user enumeration) and a failed login is answered after 1 s |
| Encryption | after login every frame is `{"n":seq,"d":hex(ChaCha20-Poly1305(json))}` under a per-session key; direction and sequence number are authenticated, so replay, reordering and tampering are rejected |
| **Loopback** | when the peer address is loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, mapped forms) the node shares the device with the Controller: **no login and no encryption**. A loopback AP is also admitted automatically (an explicit *reject* still wins). A client refuses a login-free answer on a non-loopback connection (no downgrade) |
| Node address | a node uses `controller_endpoint` (`host[:port]`, port 6550 if omitted); if empty and the device takes the Controller role it uses `127.0.0.1:<controller_port>`. The account is `controller_username`; the password lives in `/etc/wifisync/secrets/` and is write-only through the API |
| `sync` | every 15 s (retry back-off 5 → 60 s) a node sends its identity (`device_id`, roles, MAC, hostname, model, radios), the profile version it holds and — **Gateway role** — its LAN report. The answer carries the AP admission state and, for an **approved AP only**, the newer `NetworkProfile` and the Gateway LAN reports the Controller holds |
| Persistence and limits | an AP is written to `state.json` only when it is new or its state changes (flash wear); at most 64 devices may wait for admission (512 in total) and 16 Gateways report, each report is a few KiB and is dropped after 24 h of silence; LAN reports live in memory and are refreshed by the Gateways |
| AP side | the admission state is mirrored into the AP's own registry, which is what `apply` checks; the received profile is merged by version; the forwarded LAN information is only displayed |

**Gateway LAN report** (`wifisync lan report`, read-only; sources `/etc/config/network`,
`/etc/config/dhcp`, sysfs `brif`, and `ubus call network.interface.<lan> status` when available):

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `bridge` | bridge name, logical interface, whether it exists, member ports |
| `ipv4` | protocol, address, netmask/prefix, network in CIDR form |
| `dhcp` | enabled, `start`/`limit`, computed first/last leasable address, lease time, `dhcp_option`s |
| `ipv6` | policy (`disabled`, `slaac`, `dhcpv6`, `slaac_dhcpv6`, `dhcpv6_stateful`, `relay`), `dhcpv6`/`ra`/`ra_management`/`ndp`, `ip6assign`, ULA prefix, `wan6` protocol, runtime addresses and prefixes |

Security notes: without TLS an eavesdropper who records a login can try passwords offline (the
proof is an HMAC under the PBKDF2 key), so use strong passwords and keep the port inside the LAN;
nothing opens the port in the firewall (zero intrusion), so nodes in another firewall zone need an
explicit rule. The link only moves information; it never writes the local network by itself.

---

## 8. Backup and restore lifecycle (R11)

**Core rule: back up before changing; restore before exiting.**

| Timing | Action | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `pre_start` (before any probe/write) | ① if the initial baseline does not exist → create `initial/` (**immutable**) ② if it exists → verify integrity; ③ append a rolling snapshot `pre-start-<ts>/` on every start (keeping the most recent N) | once created the baseline is never overwritten, unless the user explicitly "re-baselines" |
| `running` | take a `pre-change-<ts>/` snapshot before any write (Wi-Fi/bridge/distributed configuration) | works with apply-guard to serve L1 rollback |
| `pre_stop` (before the service stops, **synchronous, blocking, time-limited**) | restore the original network from the baseline → `uci commit` → `network restart` / `wifi reload` → verify the result → clear the runtime dirty flag → only then exit | triggered by procd `stop_service`, `SIGTERM`, the `opkg` prerm hook, and shutdown |
| Next start after an abnormal exit | detect the dirty flag ⇒ prompt (optionally automatically) to restore the baseline first | fallback for `kill -9` / power loss |

**Backup contents (all text, easy to diff and compress)**

| Item | Collection method |
|------|-------------------|
| Full uci configuration | `uci export network/wireless/dhcp/firewall/system` (per file, keeping a copy of the original `/etc/config/*`) |
| Actual wireless state | `iwinfo` / `iw dev` / `iw dev <if> info` output |
| Link state | `ip -j link`, `ip -j addr`, `ip -j route` (bridge/brport membership) |
| Metadata | `manifest.json`: time, device_id, current role set, wifisync version, **per-file sha256**, `managed_keys` (the uci key paths changed by wifisync in this run) |

```
/etc/wifisync/backup/
├─ initial/                  # immutable initial baseline (authoritative restore source)
│  ├─ manifest.json
│  ├─ config/{network,wireless,dhcp,firewall,system}
│  └─ state.txt
├─ pre-start-<ts>/           # rolling snapshot before every start (5 kept)
└─ pre-change-<ts>/          # snapshot before every write (5 kept)
```

**Restore scope and safety policy**

| Item | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `restore_mode` | `managed_only` | restore only the keys in `managed_keys` that wifisync changed; unrelated user configuration is preserved. `full` overwrites from the baseline as a whole (needs UI double confirmation) |
| Idempotence | required | repeated restores give the same result; sha256 is verified first, and a missing/corrupt file rejects the restore with an alert |
| Failure handling | retry once → fall back to `/rom` | a failed restore must never delete the baseline |
| Escape hatch | `wifisync daemon --no-restore-on-stop` (or `/etc/wifisync/no-restore-on-stop`) | for when the user explicitly wants to keep the current configuration (needs UI double confirmation) |
| Space control | text only + size limit | when over the limit, rolling snapshots are pruned by policy (`initial/` is never pruned) |

---

## 9. Bridge planner (narrowed + extensible, R5 / R10)

**Enable condition (default policy, overridable by future policies)**

```
enable_bridge = roles.ap && !roles.gateway && !roles.controller    // "pure AP" only
```

1. Not a pure AP ⇒ the planner returns an **empty plan** (no-op) and produces no uci/network write.
2. Pure AP ⇒ enumerate ports (prefer DSA: `/sys/class/net/*/dsa`, `board.json`; fall back to
   `swconfig`) → merge every port (including the original WAN port) into `br-lan`.
3. Output is always `Vec<BridgePlan>` with per-bridge `vlan_filtering` / `vlans[]`; by default
   exactly one `br-lan` is generated and `bridge.name` is configurable, so **no single-bridge
   assumption appears in the code**.
4. Gateway case: only record the user-selected LAN interface (`uplink.lan_ifaces`); no bridge is
   created and no WAN member is removed.
5. Landing: write uci `config device type bridge` + `netifd reload`, then verify the actual link
   with rtnetlink.
6. Snapshot uci before the change → arm apply-guard (see §10).
7. **VLAN reservation**: `VlanDef{id, name, tagged_ports, untagged_ports}` already exists in the
   profile; this version defaults to `vlans: []`. Cross-device bridge sync only needs extended
   transport and merge logic, with no model change.

## 10. Failover (R6, optional, off by default, AP only)

| Layer | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| L1 apply-guard | connectivity is not confirmed within `confirm_timeout` after applying the distributed configuration | automatically roll back the uci snapshot + `network restart` |
| L2 link-watchdog | the **AP** loses its heartbeat with the Controller/Gateway for longer than `failsafe_timeout` | restore the network: preferably from the **initial baseline** of §8; if the baseline is unusable, fall back to `/rom/etc/config/network` + restart the network; optionally `reboot -f` |
| L3 last-resort self-healing | the daemon crashes | procd `respawn` + startup self-check; repeated failures within 24 h enter a safe mode |

* Gateway / Controller **do not trigger** a network rollback (zero-intrusion principle); they only alert.
* Configuration: `failsafe.enabled` (default `0`), `failsafe_timeout` (default `300s`),
  `failsafe_action` (`revert`|`reboot`), `failsafe_keep_ssid`, heartbeat endpoint (defaults to the Controller address; it is probed over TCP on the link port).

## 12. Milestones

| Phase | Goal | Main tasks | Deliverables | Acceptance | Estimate |
|-------|------|------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **M0** Feasibility | De-risk three technical areas | ① musl static cross-compilation PoC and size measurement ② bridge/port netlink PoC ③ rpcd shim + empty LuCI page ④ hostapd KVR parameters working under `mac80211_hwsim` | `docs/spike-*.md`, runnable PoCs | all 4 PoCs run on QEMU OpenWrt x86/64 | 3–4 days |
| **M1** Core logic library | Pure logic, unit-testable, no syscalls | configuration model (UCI/JSON both ways), role decision, capability abstraction, **bridge policy (pure AP only) + multi-bridge/VLAN list model**, KVR planner, relay planner, **Wi-Fi source parser**, `NetworkProfile` versioning and merge, **admission state machine**, failsafe state machine | `crates/wifisync-core` + tests | 100% of critical branches covered; `cargo test` green on the host | 6–8 days |
| **M2** System adapter layer | Mostly read-only probing + writes only on the AP side | read-only: uci/netifd/netlink/iwinfo capabilities and topology, **Gateway "LAN interface" selection (record only, never modify)**, connectivity probes; **snapshots and restore: full `uci export` + `iw`/`ip -j` dumps + sha256 manifest + atomic write + restore executor**; writes (AP only): staging/commit, netifd reload, rtnetlink bridge/member setup, hostapd/wpa_supplicant rendering, `wpad` check; VLAN availability probing | `crates/wifisync-sys` | non-AP dry-run diff is always 0; the AP completes "admit → distribute → apply → connect"; **snapshot/restore works standalone (manual tampering is detected)** | 7–9 days |
| **M3** Daemon and safety rails | Long-running service + admission + distribution + rollback | service loop, UNIX-socket JSON-RPC, Controller link (account login, `sync`, §7.1), **admission service (pending/approve/reject)**, **profile distribution and version negotiation**, apply-guard dead-man timer, link-watchdog (AP only), `revert` engine, procd self-healing, **lifecycle hooks (pre_start backup / pre_stop restore / synchronous SIGTERM shutdown / dirty flag)** | `crates/wifisync`, `etc/init.d/wifisync` | a rejected/not-yet-admitted AP does not change its local configuration; an AP whose link is lost restores the default network after N seconds and can rejoin; **after one start/stop cycle the network is back to its initial state** | 8–10 days |
| **M4** LuCI application | Complete visual configuration | overview, role wizard, **Gateway (LAN port selection, zero-intrusion note)**, **Controller (admission list + Wi-Fi source choice)**, **connectivity confirmation**, bridge (visible to pure AP only), KVR, relay, failsafe, **backup and restore**, diagnostics/logs; ACL and menu registration | `luci/luci-app-wifisync` | the whole flow can be completed without a CLI; the initial baseline can be viewed/verified/restored manually | 8–10 days |
| **M5** Packaging and release | Installable ipk/apk + multiple architectures | OpenWrt package Makefile, init.d, default uci configuration, rpcd ACL, multi-target CI builds, `DEPENDS`=wpad/kmod-* | `openwrt/package/wifisync/`, CI artifacts | the official SDK builds a package that works right after opkg/apk install | 4–5 days |
| **M6** Integration and acceptance | Real-topology validation | QEMU+hwsim three-node (GW/Controller/pure AP), relay scenario, roaming latency measurement, **non-intrusiveness regression (non-AP devices diff = 0)**, **start/stop loop regression (configuration is zeroed after start→stop)**, power-loss/link-loss regression, spot checks on real hardware | test report | R1–R11 all accepted | 7–9 days |

---

## 13. Testing strategy

* **Unit tests** (host, `cargo test`): role matrix, **bridge policy (enumerate all 2³ role
  combinations and assert that only a pure AP builds a bridge)**, Wi-Fi source parsing and
  disabling, `NetworkProfile` version merge, multi-bridge/VLAN lists, KVR rendering, admission
  state machine, failsafe state machine, **`managed_keys` computation, restore plan and retention
  policy**.
* **Non-intrusiveness tests**: for the `controller` / `gateway` / `controller+gateway`
  configurations, assert that the `plan` output and the uci diff are **always empty**.
* **Lifecycle tests**: after one `start → stop` cycle the diff against the initial baseline is 0;
  after `start → change configuration → stop` the baseline is restored; `start → kill -9 → start`
  detects the dirty state and recovers; tampering with the backup files makes a restore fail.
* **dry-run**: `wifisync plan` prints the uci diff that would be written; CI compares snapshots.
* **QEMU lab**: OpenWrt x86/64 + `kmod-mac80211-hwsim` virtual wireless → topology
  (Gateway / Controller / pure AP) + relay scenario, scripted in `scripts/`.
* **Regression**: rejected admission changes nothing, link-loss recovery, power loss, concurrent
  apply, corrupt uci recovery, **20 start/stop cycles with no accumulated drift**.
* **Real-hardware spot checks**: at least one MIPS wireless router and one ARM wireless router
  (including the AP-disabled behavior on a wireless-less device).

## 14. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| MIPS Tier3 targets need nightly `build-std` | complex builds | pin nightly + caching in CI; validate first in M0 |
| Small-flash devices cannot fit the binary | cannot install | size gate ≤ 3 MiB; `-Z build-std` + `panic_immediate_abort`; trim features by role if necessary |
| An AP changing the network cuts the device off | user loses connectivity | writes only for a pure AP + admission + double confirmation + dry-run + L1 apply-guard |
| Users think Gateway/Controller configure the network automatically | wrong expectations | permanent zero-intrusion text in the UI + documentation + `wifisync plan` always being empty as proof |
| Fetching Wi-Fi from the Gateway needs credentials | security/intrusion concerns | read-only fetch, credentials stored locally, explicit user authorization, **never written back** |
| `custom` source + same device ⇒ the local Wi-Fi changes | risk of losing connectivity | double confirmation + dry-run preview + apply-guard rollback + prominent warning |
| DSA/swconfig differences | bridge creation fails | dual-path detection + dry-run output comparison + rollback on failure |
| 802.11r compatibility with relay/clients | roaming anomalies | automatic fallback to `ft_over_ds`; the UI shows capability probe results |
| `wpad-basic` lacks KVR | feature unavailable | detect at startup and refuse to enable KVR, pointing to `opkg install wpad` (or the apk equivalent) |
| Future multi-bridge/VLAN needs cause model rework | refactoring cost | use list structures (`bridges[]`/`vlans[]`) from the start, with a single bridge/VLAN by default |
| **Restoring on stop overwrites later user configuration** | user configuration loss | default `restore_mode=managed_only` restores only keys changed by wifisync; `full` needs double confirmation; `--no-restore-on-stop` escape hatch |
| **A failed restore on stop makes the device unreachable** | device unreachable | sha256 verification before restoring; retry once → fall back to `/rom`; the baseline is never deleted; restore logs are kept |
| **Configuration is changed before the baseline exists** | cannot restore | `pre_start` runs before any probe/write; **fail-closed**: without a baseline any write is rejected |
| **`kill -9`/power loss leaves the network half-configured** | network in a half-configured state | dirty flag + startup self-check (prompt or automatic restore first); `pre-change` snapshots as a fallback |
| Snapshots consume flash | out of space | text only; `initial/` is never pruned, rolling snapshots keep 5 each with a size cap; when over the limit the oldest snapshots are pruned first |

## 15. Implementation status and deviations

### 15.1 Completed

| Milestone | Status | Output |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| M0 Feasibility | ✅ done (toolchain / arch mapping / build chain) | `scripts/openwrt-arch.sh`, `scripts/sdk-env.sh`, `scripts/build-musl.sh`, two CI workflows |
| M1 Core logic library | ✅ done | `wifisync-core`: `role` / `capability` / `bridge` / `wifi_source` / `profile` / `admission` / `backup` / `failsafe` / `plan` / `uci_file` / `config` / `lan` / `link` (91 unit tests) |
| M2 System adapter layer | ✅ done (read-only probing + snapshot/restore + AP write path) | `wifisync-sys`: `sysfs` / `iwinfo` / `uci` / `netifd` / `snapshot` / `restore` / `state` / `exec` / `paths` / `lan` (39 unit tests) |
| M3 Daemon and safety rails | ✅ mainly done | the single `wifisync` binary: `daemon` (lifecycle + admission + distribution + watchdog), `rpc`, `link` (Controller link), `accounts`, `ctl`, `ubus` (rpcd plugin), `secrets`, `probe`, `signals`, `log` (44 unit tests) |
| M4 LuCI application | ✅ first version done | `luci-app-wifisync`, 8 pages + menu/ACL (JS passes `node --check`) |
| M5 Packaging and release | ✅ first version done | `openwrt/package/wifisync` (Makefile + init.d + default uci + rpcd bridge + ACL), `ci.yml` + `release.yml` (24.10 `.ipk` / 25.12 `.apk`) |
| M6 Integration and acceptance | ⏳ pending | needs QEMU+hwsim and real hardware; the drill procedure is described in [`BUILDING_zh-cn.md`](BUILDING_zh-cn.md) |

Code size: **all 174 unit tests pass** (`wifisync-core` 91, `wifisync-sys` 39, `wifisync` 44), `clippy -D warnings` is clean, `cargo fmt --check` passes.

### 15.2 Deviations from the initial plan (and why)

| Original plan | Actual implementation | Reason |
|---------------|-----------------------|--------|
| tokio async runtime | **std threads + blocking I/O** | the service model is simple enough; this removes a huge runtime and makes the binary smaller and musl more stable |
| rtnetlink for bridge setup | **uci + ubus/netifd** | the idiomatic OpenWrt way, which naturally handles DSA/swconfig differences |
| device heartbeat with a pre-shared key (PSK-HMAC) | **account login (PBKDF2 + HMAC challenge-response), encrypted frames, loopback exemption** (§7.1) | the Controller needs to tell nodes apart and be managed from LuCI; accounts are revocable per node, and same-device roles must not need credentials |
| httparse for the local API | **one JSON per line over a UNIX socket** | one less protocol surface and two fewer dependencies |
| static linking (`+crt-static`) | **dynamic linking against the device's musl** (`-crt-static`) | matches the official `rust-values.mk` and yields smaller binaries; the static option is still available outside `[profile.release]` |
| detect the full wpad via the package manager | **search for `mobility_domain` + `ieee80211r` in the hostapd/wpad binary** | opkg (ipk) and apk use different database formats, while the binary signature works on both |
| the plan did not mention `roles_configured` | a new uci option was added | requirement 3 asks to drop AP from the **default settings** when there is no wireless: at install time the hardware is unknown, so the first start computes and persists the defaults from the capabilities. **Wireless presence is authoritative via `/sys/class/ieee80211/*`**; leftover uci configuration does not count (covered by a regression test) |
| `wifisyncctl` as a separate binary | merged into **a single `wifisync` binary** (daemon/ctl/ubus modes) | better for package size and packaging complexity; the rpcd bridge is therefore just one `exec` line |
| "retry once → fall back to /rom" | `network restart` fallback is implemented; the `/rom` fallback and retry are left for M6 validation on real hardware | the timing of the restore path (procd stop order) must be validated on real hardware |

### 15.3 Next steps (M6)

1. QEMU (x86/64 + `kmod-mac80211-hwsim`) three-node topology: Gateway / Controller / pure AP, to
   validate "non-AP zero changes" against a real netifd;
2. validate the `pre_stop` restore timing on real hardware (procd sends SIGTERM → the daemon
   restores synchronously → `stop_service` performs one more idempotent restore);
3. validate the Controller link (§7.1) on QEMU and real hardware: login across firewall zones, the
   port rule, and a failover heartbeat that uses the link state instead of a TCP probe;
4. if MIPS targets are needed, evaluate alternatives to `ring` (the project currently only
   commits to x86 / ARM64).
